# Introduction

I've been vibe coding with LLMs since GPT-4, and now extensively with Claude Code. These guidelines represent hard-won insights from real-world projects not just by me but from many developers (thank you internet)

First of all if you have prior coding knowledge (any language is fine) this is more than enough. 

Vibe coding is a new coding where each month the required prior knowledge matters less.

All these guidelines are the actually logical steps any developer should follow and not lifehacks. You can think of them as verbalized experience and we also provide full prompts which include some solutions to common pitfalls of vibecoding. 

This was an interesting write for me. I also extensively used AI to process and refine some thoughts. I knew something by intuition and did not really understood why. And I did not know that I did not understood them as well. I guess one of the greatest benefits of AI is that humanity will be finally understand themselves. Regardless of it dooms us or not AI is cool and building with AI feels like magic. 

## What This Book Offers

This book isn't about tricks or shortcuts. It's about establishing a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that produces clean, maintainable code. You'll learn:

- How to effectively communicate project requirements to AI
- When to trust AI output and when to intervene
- How to structure projects for optimal AI collaboration
- Practical patterns that prevent common AI coding pitfalls

And I geniunly think you will enjoy reading it as a developer. 

## Who Should Read This

- Developers curious about AI-assisted programming
- Teams looking to integrate AI tools effectively
- Anyone who has struggled with getting consistent results from AI coding assistants
- Programmers who want to amplify their productivity without sacrificing code quality

## The Journey Ahead

Throughout this book, we'll explore the evolution from traditional development to AI-assisted "vibe coding." You'll discover why conventional methodologies often clash with AI's natural patterns and learn a new approach that embraces AI's strengths while maintaining human control.

Whether you're building a simple script or architecting a complex system, these patterns will help you tame AI's power and channel it productively.

Let's begin this journey into the future of software development.
