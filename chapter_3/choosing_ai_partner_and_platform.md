# Choosing Your AI Partner and Platform

## Start with Project Criteria

Before choosing an AI, understand your project:

### Criteria 1: Project Size (File Count)

**Small (< 50 files)**
- Any AI works
- Context window rarely an issue
- Can share entire codebase

**Medium (50-500 files)**
- Need selective context sharing
- Organization becomes critical
- Some AIs handle better than others

**Large (500+ files)**
- Context window management crucial
- Need AI with strong memory/retrieval
- Architecture must support partial loading

### Criteria 2: Complexity (Abstraction Layers)

**Simple (1-2 abstractions)**
- Basic CRUD, scripts, utilities
- All AIs handle well
- Speed matters more than sophistication

**Moderate (3-5 abstractions)**
- Services, interfaces, inheritance
- Need AI that maintains consistency
- Refactoring capability important

**Complex (6+ abstractions)**
- Frameworks, metaprogramming, DSLs
- Need AI with deep reasoning
- Architectural understanding critical

### Criteria 3: Domain Specificity

**General Development**
- Web apps, APIs, scripts
- Most AIs excel here
- Documentation abundant

**Specialized Domains**
- ML/AI, embedded, blockchain
- Some AIs have better training
- Check recent knowledge cutoff

### Criteria 4: Language & Framework

**Mainstream (Python, JS, Java)**
- Universal AI support
- Extensive training data
- Patterns well understood

**Emerging (Rust, Zig, new frameworks)**
- Varies by AI training date
- Check specific capabilities
- May need more guidance

## AI Provider Limitations

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent at maintaining context
- Strong architectural reasoning
- Conservative, less likely to hallucinate
- Great at refactoring

**Limitations:**
- Smaller context window than GPT-4
- Knowledge cutoff considerations
- Sometimes overly cautious

**Best for:**
- Complex architectural work
- Projects needing consistency
- Refactoring existing codebases

### GPT-5 (OpenAI)

**Strengths:**
- Massive context window
- Broad knowledge base
- Fast and creative
- Handles ambiguity well

**Limitations:**
- Can be overconfident
- May add unnecessary complexity
- Occasional consistency issues

**Best for:**
- Large codebases
- Exploratory development
- Diverse tech stacks

### Other Providers

**Specialized Models:**
- Codex/Copilot: IDE integration
- Local models: Privacy needs
- Open source: Customization

Consider:
- Update frequency
- API stability
- Cost structure
- Privacy requirements

## Platform Choice: API vs UI

### UI Platforms

**Claude.ai Interface**
- Artifacts for code visualization
- Project knowledge persistence
- Easy file management
- Built-in version tracking

**When to use UI:**
- Exploratory development
- Learning new concepts
- Small to medium projects
- Visual feedback needed

**UI Advantages:**
- See code changes in real-time
- Easy context management
- No setup required
- Great for prototyping

### API Integration

**Direct API Access**
- Programmable workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Team collaboration
- Automated testing

**When to use API:**
- Production development
- Team environments
- Automated workflows
- Custom tooling needs

**API Advantages:**
- Scriptable and repeatable
- Version control friendly
- Custom context management
- Scale to any size

### Hybrid Approach

Many developers use both:
1. UI for exploration and design
2. API for implementation and automation

## Decision Framework

### For Complex Architecture:
Claude + UI → Design phase
API → Implementation phase

### For Large Codebases:
GPT-5 + API → Maximum context
Custom tooling → Manage window

### For Team Development:
Standardize on one provider
API for consistency
Shared prompt libraries

### For Learning/Prototyping:
UI platforms shine
Visual feedback crucial
Artifacts invaluable

## Cost Considerations

**UI Platforms:**
- Fixed monthly cost
- Unlimited within fair use
- Great for individuals

**API Access:**
- Pay per token
- Scales with usage
- Better for teams

## The Reality

Most successful vibe coders:
1. Start with UI for learning
2. Identify their preferred AI
3. Move to API for production
4. Keep UI for exploration

Choose based on:
- Current project needs
- Team size
- Budget constraints
- Technical requirements

Not based on:
- Hype or trends
- Single features
- Marketing claims
